At the core are special **RevGem links** that you create from your dashboard. Each link has a unique identifier of your choosing (ex: myapp.com?ref=twitter) and can be used to link to any page on your website (ex: myapp.com/features?ref=twitter, myapp.com/blog?ref=twitter, etc.)

You can then use these links in your marketing activities (more examples later) and RevGems will keep track of which link each visitor clicked in order to land on your website.

RevGems follows these *visitors* as they transition through your funnel to *leads* and ultimately to *customers*. A visitor becomes a lead when they sign up for a free trial, subscribe to a newsletter, request a demo, etc. And a lead becomes a customer once they've made a payment.

Because visitors, leads, customers, and their subsequent payments are all tied back to a RevGems link, we're able to show you how each link's relative performance.

Here's an example of what you might see in your RevGems dashboard:

There's all kinds of hidden revenue gems (RevGems!) that are now visible in this data. For example, you can see that even though Twitter sent you far fewer customers in absolute terms, the average value of each customer is much higher than the other channels. It probably makes sense to stop marketing on Reddit and double-down on Twitter marketing, even though it's much cheaper to get visitors from Reddit.

Even this overly-simplified example demonstrates how powerful data from RevGems is.

By stitching together the entire lifecycle of your customers you're able to get a holistic view of your marketing and immediately make decisions that directly affect your bottom line.
