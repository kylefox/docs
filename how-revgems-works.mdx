RevGems automatically tracks all traffic to your marketing site and app.

When someone new lands on your site, they become a Visitor. If they sign up to your app and/or start a free trial, they become a Lead (note: you can choose the definition of when someone becomes a Lead). If the Lead converts to a paid customer (ie. a successful payment is processed), they become a Customer.

Because visitors, leads, customers, and (most importantly) their subsequent payments are all tied back to their channel, referrer, entry page (and many more attributes), we're able to show you how each performed.

Here's an example of what you might see in your RevGems overview dashboard:

You'll also be able to see your Leads and Visitors by Channel, Referrer and Entry page.

Clicking on anything in the table will take you into a “drilldown” filtered report to dive deeper into the data. When you're in a drilldown filtered view, you'll see additional metrics such as:

- Visitors
- Leads
- Customers
- Revenue
- % of revenue
- Overall conversion rate (visitor → customer)
- Conversion rate (visitor → lead)
- Conversion rate (lead → customer)
- Revenue per Visitor
- Revenue per Lead
- Revenue per Customer (average customer value)

(For explanations of these metrics, see the Metrics Explained section)

There's all kinds of hidden revenue gems (RevGems!) that are now visible in this data.

**Example 1:** You might see that some of your bottom-of-the-funnel (BOFU) comparison pages are getting lots of traffic, but aren't actually converting into revenue. You might want to experiment with changing your positioning in the comparison page to see if it converts into revenue better.

**Example 2:** You might see another page doesn't have much organic search traffic but is contributing a decent amount of revenue. Upon further investigation, it's currently ranking 6th in organic search results. Since this page's organic traffic is converting to revenue very strongly, you might want to focus on improving the ranking of this page to drive more traffic or experiment with some paid search ads –– or both. (hint: you can look at the Average Revenue per Visitor for this segment to set your max CPC)

Even these overly-simplified examples demonstrate how powerful data from RevGems is.

By stitching together the entire lifecycle of your customers you're able to get a holistic view of your marketing and immediately make decisions that directly affect your bottom line.
