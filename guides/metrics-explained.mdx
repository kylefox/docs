Here's an overview of the current metrics shown for each link and campaign.

## Funnel

The funnel shows you counts, i.e. the number of people in each funnel state.

### Visitors

Number of unique Visitors that landed on your website where the tracking script loaded.

### Leads

Number of leads. If a person submits multiple forms that register them as a lead, they'll only show up as a single lead.

### Customers

Number of conversions. This happens when they become a paying customer. Subsequent payments from the same customer will show up as 1 Customer and doesn't impact the conversion rates.

## Conversion Rates

Conversion rates are displayed as percentages, i.e. the percentage of people that transitioned from one funnel state into the next.

<Note>
  When a visitor transitions to a lead, the lead counter is incremented by 1, but the visitor counter is *not* decremented by 1. The counts are running, cumulative totals. For example, if you had 10 visitors, and 5 visitors became leads, and 3 leads became customers, the counts would be as follows:

  - **Visitors:** 10
  - **Leads:** 5
  - **Customers:** 3
</Note>

### Visitor → Lead

The percentage of unique visitors that turn into Leads.

### Leads → Customers

The percentage of leads that turn into customers.

Measuring this can be a great indicator of how well your Lead Nurturing strategies and campaigns are working.

### Visitors → Customers

The percentage of unique visitors that turn into customers. This is your **overall conversion rate** and the one to focus on the most.

## Revenue

### Per Visitor

The average revenue earned per visitor. This is the "expected value" for each visitor that lands on your website.

By knowing the average Revenue per Visitor, you know how much you can afford to pay per click. For example, if your Revenue per Visitor is $1.75, then you could pay up to $1.75 maximum per click to turn a profit (excluding any margins or additional cost considerations for simplicity).

### Per Lead

The average revenue earned per Lead that came through this link or campaign.

This can be helpful for knowing the value of your leads and predicting how many of them will convert to customers.

This can also be useful for paid advertising when you're doing Cost per Lead (CPL) type bidding. If you know the average revenue generated per lead, you know exactly what you can afford to pay per lead to turn a profit.

### Per Customer

This is the average revenue earned per customer that came through this link or campaign.

This can be helpful for seeing if some campaigns or strategies drive higher value customers than others. Ie. are more people coming through these links choosing higher tier plans? If so, you might want to explore that channel more. If it's driving lower value customers, you might want to move away from that channel.

This can also be useful for paid advertising when you're doing Cost per Acquisition (CPA) type bidding. This will let you know the max CPA you can set for each channel to ensure you turn a profit. Ie. if your Revenue per Customer is \$300, you could set a CPA of < \$300. Or if you want to maintain a 3:1 LTV:CAC ratio, for example, you could set a CPA of $100.
