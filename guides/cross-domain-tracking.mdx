<Note>
The RevGems `<script>` tags must be installed on **all subdomains and domains** that you wish to track across. If you experience issues setting up cross-subdomain or cross-domain tracking, please verify that the tag is present on **every page of every domain.**
</Note>

## Tracking across subdomains

RevGems automatically tracks across subdomains, provided that the RevGems `<script>` tag is properly installed on each subdomain. There is no extra work required to enable cross-subdomain tracking.

**Example:** A common scenario is to have your marketing website and application running on different subdomains:

- **Marketing website:** `www.example.com`
- **Application:** `app.example.com`

In this scenario, RevGems will automatically identify a visitor as they navigate between `www.example.com` and `app.example.com`.

## Tracking across domains

Due to the limitations of how browser cookies work, some extra work is required to enable cross-domain tracking with RevGems.

**Example:**

- **Marketing website:** `example.com`
- **Application:** `example-app.com`

To enable correct attribution as visitors navigate between these two domains, add an array of domains to your `REVGEMS_CONFIG`:

```html
<script>
  window.REVGEMS_CONFIG = {
    domains: ["example.com", "example-app.com"]
  };
</script>
```

This `REVGEMS_CONFIG` snippet must be added to both websites, and must appear on the page *before* any other RevGems script tags.

## How it works

When you include the `REVGEMS_CONFIG.domains` attribute, the RevGems script will add a `revgems-session-id=<SESSION_ID>` query parameter to outgoing links to these domains. This query parameter uniquely identifies the visitor as they click between domains.

For example, if a referred visitor has landed on `www.example.com`, any links on that page which lead to `example-app.com` will have the query parameter added:

| Original Link URL                             | Cross-Domain Link URL                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `example-app.com/sign-up`                     | `example-app.com/sign-up?revgems-session-id=<SESSION_ID>`                     |
| `example-app.com/sign-up?utm_source=facebook` | `example-app.com/sign-up?utm_source=facebook&revgems-visitor-id=<SESSION_ID>` |

Note that existing query parameters on links will be correctly preserved.

## Considerations for React, SPAs, Turbo and other dynamic links

RevGems will create cross-domain links when the page loads, but will not automatically add cross-domain compatibility to links that are dynamically inserted into the page later.

Some examples when this might happen:

- A new React component is mounted
- Navigation within a React app (i.e. routing changes)
- Pages or fragments loaded with Turbo
- Any other link that’s inserted into the page with JavaScript

In this scenario, you’ll need to call `revgems("createCrossDomainLinks")` after new links have been inserted into the document. For example, with Turbo (Rails) you could add an event handler that re-runs this function:

```jsx
<script>
  document.addEventListener("turbo:visit", (event) => {
    revgems("pageView")
    revgems("createCrossDomainLinks")
  })
</script>
```

<Note>
his example includes the call to `revgems("pageView")`, which is also required when using Turbo, React, and other Single Page Applications.
