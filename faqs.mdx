  <Accordion title="How does RevGems compare to UTMs?">
    RevGems is similar to UTMs in that your traffic (and customers) can be attributed to a particular source. However, most analytics platforms that support UTM links don't support recurring-revenue tracking. Plus, RevGems links are more human-friendly and look less spammy.

    We are also working on some exciting features that will allow you to use UTM links directly in RevGems, allowing seamless integration with any existing analytics tools you're using. You'll even be able to create and manage your UTM links directly from RevGems, and gain all the additional customer lifecycle reporting that other UTM analytics tools don't offer.

  <Accordion title="Can I use RevGems for affiliate & referral marketing?">
    RevGems is not designed for affiliate and referral marketing. Our focus is to provide you with a deep, end-to-end understanding of how your marketing efforts are performing. Most of the data and functionality would not be useful for the purposes of affiliate and referral marketing.

    We recommend [Rewardful](https://www.rewardful.com/) for affiliate and referral marketing. Rewardful is specifically built to run affiliate programs for recurring-revenue businesses and provides important functionality like commission calculations and payouts, affiliate dashboards & reporting, fraud detection, and many more features that do not align with RevGem's strategy or value proposition.

  <Accordion title="Does RevGems support payment processors other than Stripe?">
    Yes, we support all payment processors üëç

    RevGems currently offers integrations for Stripe, as well as a REST API that allows you to integrate any other payment processor.

    We are developing integrations for Paddle, Chargebee, Recurly, PayPal and many more. In the meantime, you can use our REST API to integrate with these payment processors.

  <Accordion title="How is RevGems different from Google Analytics, Plausible, Fathom, etc?">
    Traditional web analytics platforms focus on website traffic and behavior, and do this really well. They can tell you how many unique people are visiting your website, which pages are most popular, break down traffic by geography, language, device, web browser, etc.

    This information is useful, but isn't enough to actually grow a profitable business.

    RevGems focuses on attributing traffic to specific links and sources, tracking traffic through the funnel states (visitor, lead, customer), and tying everything back to actual revenue earned through these sources. Contrast this to traditional web analytics platforms, which usually treat revenue-tracking as an afterthought (if they support it at all) and typically only support one-time sales (like ecommerce) as opposed to recurring payments that happen offline.

    RevGems can be used in addition to any traditional web analytics platforms that you're already using.

  <Accordion title="How is RevGems different from Baremetrics, ProfitWell, etc?">
    Tools like Baremetrics and ProfitWell are really great at providing high-level revenue analytics across your entire customer base. MRR changes over time, upgrade/downgrade and churn rates, etc.

    This is useful but doesn't tie customers and revenue back to their website behavior (including where they originally came from), which is where RevGems shines. Baremetrics and ProfitWell tell you a lot about your customers (as whole) but don't tell you anything about the people who *didn't* become customers, which is critical to assessing the effectiveness of a marketing channel.

    RevGems can be used in addition to any revenue analytics/metrics tools that you're already using.
