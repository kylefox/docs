## Request Body

<Warning>
  Either `user_id` or `visitor_id` are required to create a payment.
</Warning>

<ParamField body="visitor_id" type="uuid">
  You can pass visitor_id instead of user_id . This should be the RevGems visitor captured from JavaScript with RevGems.visitorId
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="visitor_id" type="uuid">
  You can pass visitor_id instead of user_id . This should be the RevGems visitor captured from JavaScript with RevGems.visitorId
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="user_id" type="string">
  The ID of the user in your system. Must match the `user_id` passed to `revgems("lead")` via JavaScript.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="platform_id" type="string" required>
  The unique ID of this payment in your payment processor or database.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="amount_cents" type="integer" required>
  The amount of the payment in cents. For example, a $123.45 payment should be provided as `12345`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="currency" type="string" required>
  The [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code in which `amount_cents` is denominated (USD, EUR, etc).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="description" type="string">
  A description of the payment to help you identify it in your RevGems dashboard.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="test_mode" type="boolean" default="false">
  A boolean indicating if this payment occurred in test-mode (i.e. while testing your RevGems integration) or live-mode (i.e. a real customer was billed).
  Defaults to `false` if omitted.
</ParamField>

## Response

If the payment was created successfully a `201 Created` response will be returned with a payload representing the payment.

If the `user_id` did not match a Visitor in your RevGems account, an empty `204  No Content` will be returned. This allows you to safely submit *all* your payments to the RevGems REST API without having to worry if RevGems has a Visitor for that user. When this happens, no payment is created in RevGems.

If the payment could not be created due to validation errors, a `422 Unprocessable Content` will be returned along with a description of the problem.
