RevGems uses conventional [HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general:

- Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success.
- Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, authentication failed, etc.).
- Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with RevGems servers.

Responses in the `4xx` - `5xx` range will return a JSON object with an `error` attribute describing what went wrong.
Some endpoints may also return a `details` array with more information on the specific error that occurred.

<ResponseExample>
  ```json 422 Unprocessable Content
  {
    "error": "Could not create payment",
    "details": ["Amount cents can't be blank"]
  }
  ```
  ```json 401 Unauthorized
  {
    "error": "Invalid API credentials."
  }
  ```
</ResponseExample>

## Common Error Codes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="400: Bad Request">
    Something about the request was malfomed or invalid. For example, the `Content-Type: application/json` header was missing.
    The request should not be tried again without modification.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="401: Unauthorized">
    Authentication has failed because the API Secret was either invalid or missing. See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="404: Not Found">
    The endpoint is valid but the requested resource itself does not exist.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="422: Unprocessable Content">
    The request was well-formed but was unable to be completed due to validation errors.
    For example, a required parameter was missing or invalid.
  </Accordion>
