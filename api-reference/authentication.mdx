## API Secrets

RevGems uses API Secrets to authenticate requests.
You can view and manage your API Secrets under [Settings &rsaquo; API Secrets](https://app.revgems.com/api_secrets) in the RevGems dashboard.

<Warning>
  Keep your API Secrets safe!
</Warning>

Anyone with access to your API Secret has a lot of control over your RevGems account.
Never expose them publicly through a web browser or commit them unencrypted to version control systems like git.

## Authenticating Requests

Provide your API Secret as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer api_secret_ABCDEFG123456
```

Requests can also be authenticated using HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API Secret as the username value and leave the password blank.

A `401 Unauthorized` error response will be returned if authentication fails.

<ResponseExample>
  ```json 401 Unauthorized
  {
    "error": "Invalid API credentials."
  }
  ```
</ResponseExample>
