RevGems automatically tracks all traffic that comes to your marketing site and app through UTMs and some custom parameters.

Link tracking is useful in scenarios where you can control the link and can add tracking parameters. They are often used for things such as:

- Tracking paid marketing campaigns
- Grouping traffic from different sources, mediums, etc. into a marketing campaign you can analyze as a whole
- Segmenting your traffic deeper than typical browser referrer data provides
- A/B testing ads, off-site content, etc.
- Seeing which specific post on social media drove visitors, leads, customers & revenue rather than seeing the source grouped as a whole
- Seeing which CTA enticed people to click through to your site or app
- Categorizing traffic that would normally show up as Direct

**RevGems automatically ingests the following UTMs:**

- utm_source
- utm_medium
- utm_campaign
- utm_content
- utm_term

The UTM data is being tracked by RevGems and more detailed reports will be coming in the future.

**Outside of UTMs, RevGems also currently supports the following custom parameters:**

- `?revgems=`
- `?via=`
- `?ref=`

For example, if you have a link (`company.com`) and you want to add a custom tracking parameter to the URL, you'd simply add `?revgems=token` to the end of the URL and RevGems would automatically ingest the tracking link. The final URL might look something like `company.com?revgems=twitter-thread`
