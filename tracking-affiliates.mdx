RevGems supports reporting for many of the popular SaaS affiliate platforms. If you're running an affiliate marketing program, please reach out to us at hello@revgems.com to ensure your platform is supported.

In your email, please let us know:

- Affiliate software used
- Tracking parameters used in your program (ie. `?via=`)

**Important note:** It's not possible to use RevGems for your affiliate program. You'll need a separate affiliate tracking software for this, such as [Rewardful](https://www.rewardful.com/?via=revgems). RevGems doesn't generate or calculate commissions, have an affiliate portal or provide any of the standard affiliate marketing tools needed to run your affiliate program. We simply show your affiliate marketing as a Channel so you can have a holistic view of your marketing and compare it to all your other marketing channels.
