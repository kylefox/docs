When comparing other data sources, it's critical to understand how they each work technically at a data collection, attribution and reporting level.

For example, if you're trying to compare the revenue for a given day (or date range) in your Stripe account to the revenue shown in RevGems, you need to know how they differ.

For example, RevGems default reporting is based on first-touch attribution. That means revenue is attributed back to the day the visitor first landed on your site. This is useful for marketing analytics because you can determine and match up your revenue generated to the activities you did that day (even when those people convert in the future on different dates at a staggered rate).

However, in your Stripe analytics, the revenue will be shown on the date the payment is processed. This is useful for understanding your revenue for accounting purposes and cashflow for funding your business operations. But as you can anticipate, this isnâ€™t that useful in informing your marketing decisions. They are technically different  because they serve different purposes and give you a lens into different parts of your business.
