RevGems allows you to discover your most profitable marketing channels and where your most valuable customers are coming from. This enables you to double-down on the marketing activities that are working, and reduce, tweak, or completely abandon those that aren't.

Unlike other analytics tools, RevGems lets you measure your marketing in **revenue** â€” not page views or other vanity metrics. And by revenue we mean _actual revenue_ captured by your payment processor â€” not some abstract "estimated conversion value".

RevGems is particularly useful for **subscription-based businesses** with recurring payments (like SaaS) where the value of a customer isn't determined by a single transaction, but by a series of transactions over the customer's lifetime.

The fluctuations in revenue due to upgrades, downgrades, failed payments and cancellations are automatically captured by RevGems and factored into the calculations that determine the effectiveness of each marketing channel. In addition, the conversion of free trials to paid (or churn) often happens when the user is offline and gets missed by traditional marketing analytics.
