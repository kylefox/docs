## Push Key Secrets

RevGems uses Push Key Secrets to authenticate requests. You can find these on the [Push Keys](https://app.revgems.com/tracking/push_keys) page in your RevGems dashboard. Be sure to use the <strong>test mode</strong> push key secret in your development environment and the <strong>live mode</strong> push key secret in your production environment.

<Warning>
  Keep your Push Key Secrets safe. Never expose them publicly through a web browser or commit them unencrypted to version control systems like git.
</Warning>

## Authenticating Requests

Provide your Push Key Secret as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer push_key_secret_ABCDEFG123456
```

A `401 Unauthorized` error response will be returned if authentication fails.

<ResponseExample>
```json 401 Unauthorized
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": ["Invalid push key."]
}
```
</ResponseExample>
