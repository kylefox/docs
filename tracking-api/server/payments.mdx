## Stripe Payments

If you're using Stripe, you can simply install the RevGems App into your Stripe Account as described in the [Setup Guide](https://app.revgems.com/tracking/setup/payments). Once you've done so, charges processed by Stripe will appear in your [Message Log](https://app.revgems.com/tracking/messages?q%5Bmessage_id_or_anonymous_id_or_user_id_or_account_id_or_ip_or_properties_or_context_or_authentication_or_account_hash_cont%5D=&q%5Bmessage_type_eq%5D=payment&q%5Btest_mode_eq%5D=&button=) with type <code>payment</code>.

## Other Payment Processors

You can track payments from all other platforms (PayPal, Chargebee, etc) by sending a <code>payment</code> message to the Tracking API. To do this you'll need your [Push Key Secret](https://app.revgems.com/tracking/push_keys) from your RevGems dashboard.
